facebook simple app using swiftUI (no database)

I started learning the basic of  programming use c language , then after 3 months I decided to try swiftUI , spending 2 months on the fundamentals of swift then SwiftUI , by ending this two months this was my accomplishment . At that period I heard about GitHub , but I was afraid to share my bad code , specially now while I’m uploading this project I found a lot of stupid code, I’m not going to change it here in this object ever , to give my self a little motivation for my future.I hope one year from now my code get better and better, excited to your feedback and advices , thanks you to read for the end , and sorry for taking your time.
